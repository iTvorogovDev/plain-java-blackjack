==============================RULES OF BLACKJACK==============================
-Your goal is to get as many points as possible by drawing cards, while not going over 21 points.
You need to outscore the dealer, who also tries to score as much as possible, but is not allowed 
to go over 21 points either.
*Press "Hit" to draw a card and score! The following cards have the following values:
 -2 - 10 are worth their respective numeric values
 -Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth 10 points each.
 -An Ace is worth 1 or 10 points - it's your choice!
*Hint: when you draw an Ace, it gets highlighted. You can set its value to 10 or 1 point by pressing 
UP and DOWN arrow keys respectively. If you have 2 or more Aces in your hand, you can select 
which Ace's value to change by pressing LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys.
===============================THE GAME PROCESS===============================
-You start with placing a bet and receiving two cards from the Dealer. Bet is placed by clicking chips. 
The Dealer then draws two cards, only revealing his first one.
-If either one of you get an Ace and a card with a value of 10 as your first two cards, it's a Blackjack. 
Blackjack gives you or the Dealer an instant win. 
If both you and Dealer get a Blackjack, it's a tie.
-If the dealer's first card is an Ace, you can place an insurance bet, since the Dealer's next card is
likely to be worth 10 points. An insurance bet is one half of your original bet, and you win this bet
if the dealer's second card gives him a Blackjack. This way you win back at least a part of your chips!
-After two cards have been dealt, you can press "Hit" to draw another card. 
Be careful! Going over 21 points will make you lose the game (you bust). 
After you think you have drawn enough, press "Stand" to let the Dealer make his turn.
-If you draw five cards without going over 21 points, you win even if Dealer's two cards are worth more.
-If the Dealer scores more than you, you lose. If the Dealer busts, you win.
The Dealer can only draw while his score is less than 17.
-After getting the first two cards, you can also press "Double Down". 
Your bet will increase by 2, and you only get one more card, after which the Dealer's turn follows.

-Outscoring the dealer: 2 to 1
